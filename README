Temporal Extension for PostgreSQL

This module adds data types, functions, and indexing strategies useful
for managing time data in PostgreSQL.

The PERIOD data type represents a range of time, e.g. '[2000-01-01,
2000-03-05)' represents the time from the beginning of January 2000 to
the 5th of March.
